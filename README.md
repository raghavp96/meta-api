## meta-api

meta-api is an API that I will be using for varying purposes, e.g. an endpoint that I can use for any Slack apps that I create, content for a website that I might build, etc. Because I'll be using it for perhaps many different things, it's sort of an API for other more single-purpose APIs. It (will be) hosted on Heroku
